#**APK** **D**ata**S**cience (WIP)

**APKDS** is a toolset that I created to assist in the generation of a dataset for my masters thesis
at the University of Nevada, Reno. It takes a single APK, or a directory of APKs, and extracts data that is 
commonly used in the training of Android malware classifiers. As my research is oriented around static
analysis techniques, this tool will primarily provide resources for that kind of research.

Currently, it is not in a usable state. This repository will be updated with installation instructions
once a usable alpha is completed.

It will eventually support:

- Creating N-vectors of Dalvik opcode sequences
- The generation of feature vectors of Android system characteristics
- Extracting data from one file, or many.
- Compression and serialization formats for the extracted data.
